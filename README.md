Fuzz Face Clone
===============

Copyright (c) 2014 Xav Paice

Version 0.1 - initial prototype

Based on the original Fuzz Face overdrive pedal.
I have made some modifications, mainly just using silicon transistors
plus some values to suit the differences.  Also this version runs on
12V for the PSU since that's what I mostly have on the bench.
